"""The push step: what the automation does when a branch is pushed.

For each ticket in the changelog entries that the push added, it sets Delivery to Pushed and Build to
the ticket's latest build, moves a ticket still at ToDo or OnDeck to InProgress, and raises Caution in
Attention, with one comment naming the build, when the ticket is Completed, Abandoned, Review or
Suspended and its earlier work was already pushed or delivered (new work has arrived on a finished
ticket). The first push of a ticket never raises it. It never moves a ticket out of those states.
See the guide on starting work (section 5) and project structure (section 4.3).

`--dry-run` only reports what it would do.
