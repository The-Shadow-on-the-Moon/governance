"""The release step: declare a finalized version a release.

Given a finalized version (by default the latest), it tags the commit where that version was finalized
as `released/V<major>.<sub>.<mod>`, sets the Version ticket to Delivery Released with a comment giving the
date and the tag, and sets to Released every ticket whose Delivery is Merged or Implemented and whose
version is at or below the released one. A ticket with newer work pushed (Delivery Pushed) keeps it.
A version has at most one release tag, and only a finalized version can be released. Verifying the
version first is the developer's step (guide 08, section 1.1). `--dry-run` only reports.
