"""The retire step: record where a branch ended up with a tag, then delete it.

Given a branch, an outcome (archived, suspended or abandoned) and the branch name typed again as a
confirmation, it tags the branch's last commit `<outcome>/<yyyy-mm-dd>_<branch>[_<comment>]` (the UTC date of
that commit), and only then deletes the remote branch. It refuses `main`, a wrong confirmation, a
tag name that already exists, an archived branch whose commits are not all on main, and a suspended or
abandoned branch that still has an open pull request. For an abandoned branch it sets the Delivery of
the tickets in the branch's changelog entries to Dropped. A finished hotfix branch (its tip carries a
hotfix release tag) is deleted without a retirement tag, because that tag already keeps its history.
Closing pull requests and moving tickets to Suspended or Abandoned stay a person's steps (guide 08,
section 3). `--dry-run` only reports.
